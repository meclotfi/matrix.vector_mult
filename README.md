# matrix.vector_mult

A script that Compile and run a program (Mat-Vect mult .cpp) that realize generalized matrix vector multiplication  (gemv routine in Blas Library)
<<  alpha * M[l,w].V[w] + beta * Y[w]  >> ( M a matrix of size (l,w)  and V,Y vectors   of size respectively w , l )  
In both Halide and pure C then  compare the results to check they are matching.
